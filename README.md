# PyCodeX Pro (VS Code–style editor in Python)

PyCodeX Pro is a compact, VS Code–style editor built with **PySide6**. It focuses on
look, responsiveness, and the core features most people expect from VS Code—without bloat.

### Highlights
- Tabbed editor with line numbers and current-line highlight
- Syntax highlighting (Python/JSON/Markdown basics)
- File explorer dock (fixed Windows path handling)
- Command palette with fuzzy filtering (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Project-wide search (threaded)
- Integrated task runner (run arbitrary shell commands)
- Git panel (status, stage-all, commit) via `git` CLI
- Markdown preview dock
- Settings persisted to `~/.pycodex_pro/settings/settings.json`
- Tiny plugin system (drop `.py` into `.../plugins/user`)
